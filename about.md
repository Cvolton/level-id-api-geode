# Editor Level ID API

Assigns Level IDs to Editor levels and level lists that other mods can use to refer to them.

Please note, that these "Editor Level IDs" have nothing to do with the online level IDs used by the actual game.

## How does this work?

See [README.md](https://github.com/Cvolton/editor-ids-geode/blob/main/README.md) for documentation how this works, usage and other developer notes.
